Binder
~~~~~~

Binder is a cloud server for running notebook examples. This method
is integrated to the documentation and it is the easiest method to run any example code.

.. note ::

    Due to limitations on Binder instances in RAM,
    most of the examples won't run there or are
    prohibitive slow.

All example notebooks in the documentation come with Binder integration.
Press "Launch binder" badge on the top of any example page in the documentation.
This will automatically create a personal runnable notebook for you on a cloud server.
