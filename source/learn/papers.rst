An Investor’s Guide to Crypto
-----------------------------

We provide practical insights for investors seeking exposure to the growing cryptocurrency space. Today, crypto is much more than just bitcoin, which historically dominated the space but accounted for just a 21% share of total crypto trading volume in 2021. We discuss a wide variety of tokens, highlighting both their functionality and their investment properties. We critically compare popular valuation methods. We contrast buy-and-hold investing with more active styles. We only deem return data from 2017 representative, but the use of intraday data boosts statistical power. Underlying crypto performance has been notoriously volatile, but volatility-targeting methods are effective at controlling risk, and trend-following strategies have performed well. Crypto assets display a low correlation with traditional risky assets in normal times, but the correlation also rises in the left tail of these risky assets. Finally, we detail important custody and regulatory considerations for institutional investors.

Low-volatility strategies for highly liquid cryptocurrencies
------------------------------------------------------------

Managing extreme price fluctuations in cryptocurrency markets are of central importance for investors in this market segment. Using a sample of highly liquid cryptocurrencies from January 2017 to June 2021, this paper proposes a dynamic investment strategy that selects cryptocurrencies based on their historical volatility and is complemented by a simple stop-loss rule. Our results reveal that investing in highly concentrated low volatility cryptocurrency portfolios with six to twelve months volatility look-back and holding period generate statistically significant excess returns. By including a simple stop-loss rule, the downside risk of cryptocurrency portfolios is reduced markedly, and the Sharpe ratios are improved significantly.

How to avoid overfitting trading strategies
-------------------------------------------

Running a lossy trading strategy would be a very costly mistake, so we spend a lot of effort on assessing the expected performance of our strategies. This task gets harder when we have limited data for this evaluation or when we experiment with the strategy for a longer time and risk manually overfitting the strategy on the same out-of-sample data.

An Efficient Algorithm for Optimal Routing Through Constant Function Market Makers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Constant function market makers (CFMMs) such as Uniswap have facilitated trillions of dollars of digital asset trades and have billions of dollars of liquidity. One
natural question is how to optimally route trades across a network of CFMMs in order
to ensure the largest possible utility (as specified by a user). We present an efficient algorithm, based on a decomposition method, to solve the problem of optimally executing
an order across a network of decentralized exchanges

Can machines learn finance?
---------------------------

Machine learning for asset management faces a unique set of challenges that differ markedly from other domains where machine learning has excelled. Understanding these differences is critical for developing impactful approaches and realistic expectations for machine learning in asset management. We discuss a variety of beneficial use cases and potential pitfalls, and emphasize the importance of economic theory and human expertise for achieving success through financial machine learning.

Automated Market Making and Arbitrage Profits in the Presence of Fees
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We consider the impact of trading fees on the profits of arbitrageurs trading against an
automated marker marker (AMM) or, equivalently, on the adverse selection incurred by liquidity
providers due to arbitrage. We extend the model of Milionis et al. [2022] for a general class
of two asset AMMs to both introduce fees and discrete Poisson block generation times. In our
setting, we are able to compute the expected instantaneous rate of arbitrage profit in closed
form. When the fees are low, in the fast block asymptotic regime, the impact of fees takes a
particularly simple form: fees simply scale down arbitrage profits by the fraction of time that
an arriving arbitrageur finds a profitable trade.

Momentum and trend following trading strategies for currencies and bitcoin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Momentum trading strategies are thoroughly described in the academic literature and used in many trading strategies by hedge funds, asset managers, and proprietary traders. Baz et al. (2015) describe a momentum strategy for different asset classes in great detail from a practitioner’s point of view. Using a geometric Brownian Motion for the dynamics of the returns of financial instruments, we extensively explain the motivation and background behind each step of a momentum trading strategy. Constants and parameters that are used for the practical implementation are derived in a theoretical setting and deviations from those used in Baz et al. (2015) are shown. The trading signal is computed as a mixture of exponential moving averages with different time horizons. We give a statistical justification for the optimal selection of time horizons. Furthermore, we test our approach on global currency markets, including G10 currencies, emerging market currencies, and cryptocurrencies. Both a time series portfolio and a cross-sectional portfolio are considered. We find that the strategy works best for traditional fiat currencies when considering a time series based momentum strategy. For cryptocurrencies, a cross-sectional approach is more suitable. The momentum strategy exhibits higher Sharpe ratios for more volatile currencies. Thus, emerging market currencies and cryptocurrencies have better performances than the G10 currencies. This is the first comprehensive study showing both the underlying statistical reasons of how such trading strategies are constructed in the industry as well as empirical results using a large universe of currencies, including cryptocurrencies.

Momentum trading in cryptocurrencies: short-term returns and diversification benefits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We test for the presence of momentum effects in cryptocurrency market and estimate dynamic conditional correlations (DCCs) of returns between momentum portfolios of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. First, investment portfolios are constructed adherent to the classic J/K momentum strategy, using daily data from twelve cryptocurrencies for over a period of three years. We identify the existence of momentum effect, which is highly significant for short-term portfolios but disappears over the longer term. Second, we show that cross correlations of weekly returns between momentum portfolio of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets are unlike correlations of returns between traditional assets. Third, we find that momentum portfolios of cryptocurrencies not only offer diversification benefits but also can be a hedge and safe haven for traditional assets.
