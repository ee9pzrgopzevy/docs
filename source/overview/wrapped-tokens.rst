.. _wrapped token:

Wrapped tokens
==============

Due to legacy design issues with :term:`EVM compatible` blockchains,
any :term:`native token` must be "wrapped" in order it to be used with
:term:`decentralised exchanges <decentralised exchange>`.

To distinguish wrapped tokens from their native token counterparts,
a letter `W` is added at the front of the token. E.g.

.. code-block:: text

    BNB -> WBNB

Even though tokens always need to be wrapped to trading,
sometimes they are still referred as "BNB" in the user interface,
when though on the smart contract level you are usinb WBNB token.
